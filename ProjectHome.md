# belief introduction #
Use the [Quex lexer generator](https://sourceforge.net/projects/quex/) to replace the hand-crafted Tokenizer class in Code-Completion plug-in of [Codeblocks IDE](http://www.codeblocks.org/).

The project is tested under Windows (but it is quite easy to used under Linux or other OS). Codeblocks project file (cbp) file are supplied.

# build the project (simple way) #
Just check out the svn source code, and open the cbp file in Codeblocks IDE, and build and run.

# build the project (complex way) #
If you need to change the cpp.qx (lexer grammar)
you need these prerequisite packages below:
  1. python: [Python](http://www.python.org/download/) installed on your system.
  1. quex : the Quex version should at least 0.57.1 or newer, can be download from [Browse Lexical Analyzer Generator Quex Files on SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/quex/files/)

Once installed the quex, you should have a environment variable
```
QUEX_PATH=[You path of quex-installration]
```

Then the quex based lexer code should be generated by running the batch file named "cpp.bat" under the cppparser subfolder.
